# Overview

Using BITFRONT API, you do not have to access the BITFRONT website to check your account status, trading history, or to buy and sell crypto. You can also automate your trading orders based on set criteria, such as buying a set amount of coins when the price drops by more than 5%.

## Prerequisites

BITFRONT API is RESTful.
All requests and responses are transmitted via HTTPS, meaning that you can call APIs from any platform that supports HTTPS.
For successful operation of API request calls, read this section and descriptions of each API carefully.

You must get your API Key before you can use the BITFRONT API. First, log in to the [BITFRONT website](https://bitfront.me) and request for the API Key under “Account” \> “OPEN API”.

Once completed, you will receive an API KEY and API SECRET.
All API requests have to pass an API KEY in the header, and the requests that have a valid API KEY are allowed.
API SECRET is a secret key to sign API requests. For details, see [Authentication and security policy](/2_Authentication_and_Security_Policy.md#authentication-and-security-policy).

Yet, the following APIs can be used without API KEY:

- [Server time](api/public/v1-public-time-get.md)
- [Market trade history](api/market/v1-market-public-tradeHistory-get.md)
- [Tick values](api/market/v1-market-public-currentTickValue-get.md)
- [Order book](api/market/v1-market-public-orderBooks-get.md)
- [Market coin pair policy](api/market/v1-market-public-coins-pairPolicy-get.md)

## Endpoint

The endpoint of BITFRONT API is as follows:

    https://openapi.bitfront.me/{version}/{api_name}?{query_string}

  - `https://openapi.bitfront.me/` is the base URL of the API.
  - `version` is the version of the API set.
  - `api_path` is the path of the API to call.
  - `query_string` is a set of query parameters for the API. Each parameter is a `key=value` pair followed by an ampersand (&).

## Request

All API requests on BITFRONT API must meet the following requirements:

  - All requests must be sent via HTTPS.
  - GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE method can be used depending on the API.
  - **For POST, PUT, and DELETE methods, parameters must be passed via a query string, via a request body generated by `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`.** Both a query string and request body can be used simultaneously.
  - All requests must be signed. For more information, see [Signature policy](/2_Authentication_and_Security_Policy.md#signature-policy).
  - Signature is for one-time use only and any request is rejected if the same signature is used again.
  - The requests per second (RPS) handled by BITFRONT API follows the [RPS limit policy](/2_Authentication_and_Security_Policy.md#rps-limit-policy).

### Mandatory header parameters

#### For public and market APIs

APIs starting with `/v*/public` or `/v*/market/public` do not have mandatory header parameters.

#### For trade and account APIs

Except for APIs starting with `/v*/public` or `/v*/market/public`, all the other APIs must include the following parameters in HTTP request header:

| **Parameter name** | **Description**                                                                                           |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `X-API-KEY`        | API KEY of user issued by BITFRONT  |
| `X-API-SIGN`       | HMAC-SHA256 signature, pre-generated in compliance with the [Signature policy](2_Authentication_and_Security_Policy.md#signature-policy) section |
| `X-API-TIMESTAMP`  | UTC Unix Epoch in milliseconds    |
| `X-API-NONCE`      | A 5-digit arbitrary positive integer that has not been used before within the same timestamp (e.g. 12345) |

Here is an example of a request.

``` bash
curl https://openapi.bitfront.me/v1/trade/openOrders?market=ETH&currency=BTC&max=100 \
  --header "X-API-KEY: <your API KEY>" \
  --header "X-API-SIGN: <the user generated message signature>" \
  --header "X-API-TIMESTAMP: <a timestamp for your request>" \
  --header "X-API-NONCE: <a nonce value>"
```

## Response

Results for the BITFRONT API requests are returned as response objects.
The HTTP status code is 200 OK when the API server has no problem and you can find detailed information about the results in the response object.

> **Note**
>
> The HTTP status code does not represent the outcome of a request. A 200 OK status code does not mean that the request was successfully processed.

The response object includes the following fields:

| Field           | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `responseData`  | holds the actual result data in a JSON format. The structure of the object varies depending on the API, see the [description of each API](/3_Reference.md#reference).                                                                                                                                          |
| `responseTime`  | shows the response time from the API server.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `statusCode`    | provides the status of the request’s result. You must always check this field to see if the request was successfully processed. It is 1000 for successfully processed requests and any other values are considered as failures. For more information, see [`statusCode` definitions](#statuscode-definitions). |
| `statusMessage` | shows detailed information about the request’s result. This field is useful when you need to check the reason for failure when the `statusCode` is not 1000.                                                                                                                                                   |
| `timezone`      | shows the time standard of `responseTime`. It is always “UTC”. See the note below.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

> **Note**
>
> All time related fields are represented in [UTC Unix Epoch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time) in milliseconds.

Below are the examples of response objects.

``` json
